# OSProject
This exercices are made to use threads and semaphores.

Exo01 : Compute the syracuse suit using threads and memoriszation (caching).     
Exo02 : Compute the pascal triangle using threads.      

## Installation

Use clang or gcc. 
```bash
sudo apt install clang
```
For gcc use build-essential to get additional libs. 
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential 
```

Available target : 

| Target        | Description |
| ------------- | --------------------------|
| all           | Make all possible target  |
| clean         | delete build folder content (bin,objects,etc...)  |
| build         | create build folder  |
| exo1          | compile the first exercise   |
| exo2          | compile the second exercise   |

> You can use the DEBUG flag in Makefile, it will use address sanitizer and g3 to debug.     
> `-pthread` is used at compile time. Make sur that your gcc have lib for pthread, in some case pthread is not included.
